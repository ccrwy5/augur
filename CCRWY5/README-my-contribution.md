## CS4320 Final Project Contributions
##### My team was a full stack team comprised of 4 members, 1 specializing in backend and API technologies, myself and another group member were frontend specialized, and a fourth and final member was of varying skills and comfortable helping in any area.

##### My main contributions were mainly dealing with the overall look of the UI and with the chart representations of data. I started out creating a sample frontend UI (using simple HTML and CSS with the help of a few frameworks) of what I thought we could use for the project and presented it to the group in class. Unfortunately, I was not able to provide too much physical code directly. This is because the UI was elected to be done using Angular, a technology I have barely any experience in. Because of this, I attempted to learn Angular in a "crash course" style to figure out what was/wasn't feasible to use for our UI. I was able to provide advice and insight from my experience with other front end technologies, and help my frontend counterpart implement these ideas into Angular code.

##### As mentioned, I also contributed to the chart data representations used in the app using Chart.js. I researched chart.js (we got the suggestion to use that library from a fellow classmate) and performed small sample tests with the charts in local files to see what they looked liked and if they'd be what we would want in our app. I thus provided documentation links and samples to my frontend partner to experiment with and ultimately implement into the app. 

##### Note: I will put a copy of the UI code samples/mock up that I made in the submission folder.
